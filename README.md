#This is repo of me learning to integrate esewa into my application

# Just chanage the success url, and failure url to your success and failure page in the .env(I know, I shouldnot have added .env as it is, haha Have Fun!) : If transaction is valid and success, esewa will redirect you to your success url with additional query params like oid=1684692444631--7.477796246284781--1684692444631-fjlkawf-SuzanRana&amt=100.0&refId=0005K35, oid is your order id in this case, which you sent to esewa as pid, amt is amount, and refId is unique reference id of the transaction generated by esewa for transaction validation.

#THIS IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY:
ESEWA ID : 9806800003
PASSWORD: Nepal@123 (check the esewa docs)
TOKEN: 123456 (not mentioned in the docs currently)
